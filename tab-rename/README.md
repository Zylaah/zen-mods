# Tab Rename

Enhances Zen Browser's tab renaming functionality to allow renaming of non-pinned tabs (except essential tabs) and persists custom tab titles across browser sessions.

## Features

- Allows renaming of both pinned and unpinned tabs (double-click to rename)
- Blocks renaming only for essential tabs (system tabs)
- Persists custom tab titles using Firefox's SessionStore
- Restores renamed titles when tabs are restored after browser restart
- Handles edge cases like tabs restored individually or late
