# Auto Picture-in-Picture Setting

Adds an Auto Picture-in-Picture toggle control to Zen Browser's unified site data panel. The setting only appears when media (audio/video) is detected on the current tab, allowing you to quickly enable or disable Firefox's automatic Picture-in-Picture feature when switching tabs.

## Features
