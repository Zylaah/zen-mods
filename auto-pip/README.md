# Auto Picture-in-Picture Setting

Adds an Auto Picture-in-Picture toggle control to Zen Browser's unified site data panel. The setting only appears when media (audio/video) is detected on the current tab, allowing you to quickly enable or disable Firefox's automatic Picture-in-Picture feature when switching tabs.

## Features

- Automatically detects when media is playing on the current tab
- Adds a toggle in the site data panel (accessible via the address bar)
- Shows/hides the setting dynamically based on media playback state
- Updates when switching tabs or when media starts/stops
- Persists the preference setting across browser sessions
